//! Library provides three main procedures:
//!
//! ## 1. PSBT-based state transition construction.
//!
//! Given PSBT-originating set of outpoints the procedure creates all required
//! state transitions for all contracts, adding necessary information to PSBT
//! for constructing bundles and tapret proofs. The actual state transitions are
//! saved into the stash even before witness transactions are mined. They may be
//! also put into PSBT, if needed for the hardware signers.
//!
//! ## 2. PSBT-based finalization.
//!
//! Procedure takes PSBT with all information for constructing transition
//! bundles and taprets and
//! a) generates final tapret commitment;
//! b) creates consignment for the main transfer.
//!
//! ## 3. Descriptor-based contract state.
//!
//! Checks descriptor UTXO set and updates contract, removing outdated outputs.
//! For instance, after consignment creation, a new state transition is already
//! present in the contract state, even before the witness transaction is mined.
//! Descriptor filtering of the contract state will show a valid result, since
//! a new state without mined witness will not be displayed. Once the witness
//! gets mined, a new state appears, and previous state gets invalidated since
//! it no longer assigned to an unspent transaction output.
